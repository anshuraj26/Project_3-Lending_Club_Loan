💳 **Lending Club Loan Risk Analysis**


📌**Overview**

In this project, I analyzed Lending Club loan data entirely in Microsoft Excel to understand which borrowers are more likely to default and which factors drive loan risk. The objective was to evaluate whether existing risk indicators are effective and to support better lending and underwriting decisions.

The analysis is business-focused, emphasizing portfolio risk, borrower behavior, and growth trends, rather than technical modeling.

❓**Key Business Questions**

1. Does the loan grading system accurately predict default risk?

2. Are long-term loans (60 months) riskier than short-term loans (36 months)?

3. Does higher income reduce the likelihood of default?

4. Which loan purposes drive the highest loan volume?

5. Does income verification actually lower portfolio risk?

6. How has loan volume changed over time?

🔍**How the Analysis Was Done (Excel)**

1. Cleaned and standardized raw loan data using Excel functions and formulas

2. Converted loan terms, employment length, and dates into analysis-ready formats

3. Grouped borrowers into meaningful categories such as income bands and home ownership

4. Removed duplicates and handled missing values to ensure accurate metrics

5. Created key portfolio KPIs such as total loan volume, risk rate, and average interest rate

6. Used Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to analyze default risk across loan grades, terms, income groups, and verification status

7. Analyzed loan volume trends over time to identify business growth and slowdown phases

8. Built interactive Excel dashboards to clearly present insights to stakeholders

🛠️**Tools Used**

Microsoft Excel

Data cleaning and preparation

Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts

KPI calculations and dashboards

💡**Key Insights**

1. Loan grade is the strongest indicator of default risk, validating the grading system

2. 60-month loans carry significantly higher risk than 36-month loans

3. Higher-income borrowers default less often, providing a financial safety buffer

4. Debt consolidation and credit card loans account for the majority of issued loans

5. Verified loans show higher default rates, suggesting verification is applied to higher-risk borrowers

🎯**Outcome**

This project provides clear, actionable insights to improve loan risk assessment, refine underwriting rules, and balance portfolio growth with risk control. It demonstrates how Excel alone can be used to deliver meaningful business intelligence and support data-driven decision-making.
